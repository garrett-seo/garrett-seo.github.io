Hello! I am a Computer Science Master's student at Rutgers University being advised by Prof. Xintong Wang.

My research interests are in EconCS, multi-agent systems, and game theory. I'm currently focusing on negotiation and bargaining games, including solving game-theoretic optimal strategies, multi-issue negotiation, and LLM-based agents.
